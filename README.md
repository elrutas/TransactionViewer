# TransactionViewer
A small project to practice with algorythms.

The app loads transactions and conversion rates from json files. Some conversions may not be specified in _rates.json_. In case they are needed, they should be calculated using the known conversions.

A Breadth-first search algorythm is implemented to find conversion rate.
